lexapro.Post216.Sentence2	My experience with Lexapro has been extremely positive.
lexapro.Post216.Sentence3	The side effects have been very minor for me.
lexapro.Post216.Sentence4	The most striking thing about Lexapro compared to other anti-depressants I have taken is that I do not feel "medicated" or somehow altered.

zoloft.Post172.Sentence3	About 3 months ago,I began to have symptoms- not so much depression but of mood swings , severe irratibility & anger .
zoloft.Post172.Sentence4	I went to my doc & asked to try something new so we tried Cymbalta (made me manic), then Lexapro (made me completely emotionless).
zoloft.Post172.Sentence5	I have been on a downward spiral since going off zoloft, to the point that my doc has me on 2-3 mg of Xanax a day.
zoloft.Post172.Sentence6	Yesterday, I went in to my doc & said please, please dear God, put me back on Zoloft.
zoloft.Post172.Sentence7	If I thought it was bad before, I was SO SO wrong.
zoloft.Post172.Sentence8	Doc says that after being on Zoloft for so long, my brain may now have a chemical need for it.
zoloft.Post172.Sentence9	Not addiction, just an alteration.
zoloft.Post172.Sentence10	At least with Zoloft I can function and take care of my family.
zoloft.Post173.Sentence1	slight sexual problems , delayed ejaculation .
zoloft.Post173.Sentence2	other than that no problems.
zoloft.Post174.Sentence1	Initially constipation but it went away after a few weeks .
zoloft.Post174.Sentence2	This literally saved my life.
zoloft.Post174.Sentence3	Much better than Paxil (made me gain weight and sleepy) or Wellbutrin (made me suicidal and grumpy.
zoloft.Post174.Sentence4	I have a libido on this stuff unlike the other SSRI's.
zoloft.Post175.Sentence1	Over a 10 yr period I have gained 70 lbs Other than that, it helped me with my anxiety attacks and depression .
zoloft.Post175.Sentence2	I also went to a pychiatrist and he helped me change the way i process my thoughts.
zoloft.Post175.Sentence3	I used to have one negative thought that would snowball into two etc So with behavioral therapy and 100 mg a day of Zoloft, I was able to feel at ease.
zoloft.Post175.Sentence4	Keep record of your weight when starting.
zoloft.Post175.Sentence5	My doctor and I just realized that my weight gain might be from the Zoloft.
zoloft.Post175.Sentence6	With the approval and supervision of my doctor I am trying to get off of the medication.
zoloft.Post175.Sentence7	I have gone down to 50 mg a day, and had no withdrawls.
zoloft.Post175.Sentence8	I have tried to quit cold turkey and have experienced what some call "brain shivers".
zoloft.Post175.Sentence9	It usually happens with another antidepressant.
zoloft.Post175.Sentence10	A simple Google search will bring up what myself and other people experience.
zoloft.Post175.Sentence11	This was only when I was getting OFF of the Zoloft too quickly.
zoloft.Post176.Sentence1	Initial side effects included period tremors, mainly in my hands, that went away after I had been on the med for a few weeks.
zoloft.Post176.Sentence2	Ongoing side effects include nausea (if I don't eat something with it), sleepiness , and difficulty achieving orgasm .
zoloft.Post176.Sentence3	Am taking this in combination with Wellbutrin, which counteracts the sexual side effects and the sleepiness .
zoloft.Post176.Sentence4	Overall I am delighted with the difference Zoloft has made for me in letting me lead a normal life, and I consider a bit of nausea to be quite worth it.
zoloft.Post177.Sentence1	I've taken it so long- 14 yrs- that today I cannot name any undesirable side-effects.
zoloft.Post177.Sentence2	In the very first years, there was difficulty in achieving orgasm, but no ED at all.
zoloft.Post177.Sentence3	I remember the first four days on the drug were weird: I felt jittery and a little elated, rather like the opening to a hallucinogenic drug.
zoloft.Post177.Sentence4	But that subsided very soon.
zoloft.Post177.Sentence5	As everyone knows, you have to give the drug about a month before you decide you might cycle off it; people who decide after a week that "it's not for them" are really not using the drug correctly.
zoloft.Post177.Sentence6	I will say that withdrawal from Zoloft (or any SSRI) is a very unpleasant experience: severe mental confusion, and objects in your peripheral vision seem to dance about, wheel and lurch unexpectedly (not unlike the "tracers" of LSD).
zoloft.Post177.Sentence7	You seem to "miss" seconds of time.
zoloft.Post177.Sentence8	Crying bouts resume at the slightest provocation (Ask my family about the time I started crying over the breakfast tabl.
zoloft.Post177.Sentence9	I tell people that Zoloft gives me a Floor.
zoloft.Post177.Sentence10	A floor under my feet beneath which I shall not sink This means that I'll still have good days and bad, but I know i have the security of an emotional "floor" beneath my feet.
zoloft.Post177.Sentence11	Before this medicine, I could sinkand sink and sink into depression , seemingly without end.
zoloft.Post177.Sentence12	The biggest gift of Zoloft, I'd say, is that it allows me to *think*; those of us severely depressed know that, even worse than the dysthymia, is the inability to read printed matter .
zoloft.Post177.Sentence13	you'll read and re-read the same paragraph over and over again!
zoloft.Post177.Sentence14	Now I can think and read, and that's everything.
zoloft.Post177.Sentence15	They say the effects of Zoloft are smooth and constant, based on blood levels, but damned if I don't find myself feeling a little more cheerful/alert every day, an hour after popping my pills.
zoloft.Post178.Sentence1	Night sweats but not sure it's from the Zoloft.
zoloft.Post178.Sentence2	I also didn't like the weird feelings when I first started so I took half doses until I got used to them and then moved to the full dose.
zoloft.Post178.Sentence3	I classify my life as "BZ" & "AZ" (before zoloft and after zoloft).
zoloft.Post178.Sentence4	I spent over sixty years depressed before.
zoloft.Post178.Sentence5	With zoloft I now know what "normal" life is like.
zoloft.Post178.Sentence6	But in addition to eliminating the depression it also eliminated the highs .
zoloft.Post178.Sentence7	(I used to consider myself a "mini manic depressive ".)
zoloft.Post178.Sentence8	I take 100mg a day.
zoloft.Post179.Sentence1	any I had initially went away after a few weeks but the lack of sex drive is why I had to quit taking it.
zoloft.Post179.Sentence2	Some mental fogginess in school.
zoloft.Post179.Sentence3	I have taken many drugs but Zoloft was the best for me.
zoloft.Post179.Sentence4	No weight issues, energy was good, sleep was amazing.
zoloft.Post179.Sentence5	Success with these meds truly depends on staying in touch with your physician so they can adjust or change as necessary.
zoloft.Post179.Sentence6	This drug works fast and worked great for me!
zoloft.Post179.Sentence7	I have been on Prozac (loved it but I got migranes), Effexor, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, and mood stabilizers Depakote and Lamictal.
zoloft.Post179.Sentence8	Today I start Celexa since it has less sexual side effects.
zoloft.Post179.Sentence9	If I was single, my only choice would be the best for me, Zoloft.
zoloft.Post180.Sentence1	Makes me sleepy .
zoloft.Post180.Sentence2	As long as I take it in the evening I have no problems with Zoloft.
zoloft.Post180.Sentence3	I have been on anti-depressants for about 20 years and this works better than anything else.
zoloft.Post181.Sentence1	Equilibrium problems at 50 mg. dropped by to 25 mg solved problem
zoloft.Post182.Sentence1	For the first couple weeks I was very tired, felt lethargic at times and more anxious at others.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence2	I also had an irrational fear that this drug was going to cause me to 'lose my mind' or have some other horrible side effect that SOOO many people write about on-line.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence3	I stuck with it, and I am very glad I did.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence4	It has been 4.5 months and have had no adverse side effects from Zoloft.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence5	I am only on 25 mgs, but I feel it is working for me.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence6	I have way more energy, actually crave social situations, when before I preferred solitude , I have a sex drive, and more confidence.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence7	The difference was very subtle, but remarkably and slowly life-changing.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence8	I am still me.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence9	I still feel, my emotions are not numb (thank God), but I no longer internalize , and foster negative feelings .
zoloft.Post182.Sentence10	In addition, I am more able to cope with life's blows without sinking into the abyss.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence11	As I've already noted, Zoloft is working very well for me.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence12	4.5 months ago when I was researching Zoloft on-line, it seemed that the only people who wrote comments about Zoloft were those with horrible experiences, or had some other negative thing to say about it.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence13	Needless to say I was discouraged, very fearful and skeptical to try Zoloft for my first time.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence14	I felt I was relatively normal, with just mild depression and anxiety , I certainly did not want to make my situation WORSE!
zoloft.Post182.Sentence15	Well I am happy I stuck it out for the initial two weeks (you'll make it through too), because now I feel like myself, only fine-tuned.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence16	I promised myself that IF Zoloft worked for me, I would come back and write my experience here.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence17	Keep in mind.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence18	it is alot easier for anxious / depressed people, like most of us on this sight are/were to some degree, to report negative feedback.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence19	People who the drug is working for (like myself), would rather be out enjoying our lives than on the computer writing about Zoloft.
zoloft.Post182.Sentence20	But I

zoloft.Post184.Sentence2	I seem to have been born depressed .
zoloft.Post184.Sentence3	Unhappy, often suicidal throughout childhood and adolescence.
zoloft.Post184.Sentence4	Anti-depressants became available when I was in my twenties, and I was on and off them for years.
zoloft.Post184.Sentence5	The older types worked up to a point, but there was always an underlying feeling that depression would emerge, and sometimes it did.
zoloft.Post184.Sentence6	But since Zoloft, I've been able to live without that fear.

zoloft.Post185.Sentence5	It took a couple of weeks for me to realize much of a difference with Zoloft, but it has, without a doubt, saved my life.
zoloft.Post185.Sentence6	The only complaint I have is that I found myself eating more than usual which caused some weight gain , but none that can't be managed without increasing exercise and eating healthier.
zoloft.Post185.Sentence7	I had some fatigue when first starting the prescription, but I no longer notice it.
zoloft.Post185.Sentence8	Just make sure that you DO NOT go without Zoloft for more then a couple of days once you have been on it for awhile!
zoloft.Post185.Sentence9	The withdrawal is AWFUL!
zoloft.Post185.Sentence10	Due to various causes, I went a week without my prescription and had terrible vertigo, insomnia, nausea and irritability.
zoloft.Post185.Sentence11	Otherwise, great!

zoloft.Post190.Sentence3	After a few weeks that ended as well as my crying spells , my hate for life , and my suicidal thoughts .

zoloft.Post190.Sentence6	In other words, I was not in my right mind.
